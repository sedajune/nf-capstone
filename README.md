## `Description`

**This is a capstone project for [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) web development bootcamp.**

My capstone project “Plant Buddy” was created to help you locate and share horizontal, as well as vertical green space with other plant enthusiasts in your area. Additionally, it offers you a seed exchange, a plant log and a DIY section to live the full green experience and fulfill your plant needs.

### `Demo`

You can find the hosted version on Vercel: [Plant Buddy Demo](https://nf-capstone-black.vercel.app)
